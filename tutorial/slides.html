#  REST API

A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests
to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

![:scale 70%](https://phpenthusiast.com/theme/assets/images/blog/what_is_rest_api.png)

Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that
defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services
that conform to the REST architectural style, called RESTful Web services (RWS),
provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.
RESTful Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate
textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set
of stateless operations.

## Advantages

- **Loose Coupling**: When services are loosely coupled, a change to one service
should not require a change to another. The whole point of this Microservice
thing is being able to make a change to one service, and deploy it, independent
of a need to change any other part of the system. This is really quite important.

- **Strong Cohesion**: We want related behaviour to sit together, and unrelated
behaviour to sit elsewhere. Why? Well, if we want to change behaviour, we want
to be able to change it in one place, and release that change as soon as possible.
